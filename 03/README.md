animations preserve object constancy and allow the user to follow the data across views

animation design by [Heer and Robertson](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/animated_transitions/)
inspired by [Byron and Wattenberg](http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/)

this iteration generates `random` data and draws `vertical` bars

an [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) implementation in something like the [airbnb style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
